		<hr>

		<h1 style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1>


		<p>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">By conducting the differential expression analysis, we sought to identify genes that exhibit significant differences in expression between non-aggressive and aggressive tumor groups based on the grading system and molecular subtypes. This study lays the foundation for further investigations and highlights the importance of accurate tumor classification in breast cancer management.</span>
		</p>

		<p>
		  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;">Objective:</span>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with varying levels of aggressiveness. Breast cancer classification based on aggressiveness is crucial for optimal treatment decisions and patient prognosis. The objective of this preliminary study (Project 1) was to assess the effectiveness of two classification approaches, the grading system and molecular subtypes, in differentiating aggressiveness levels in breast cancer. </span>
		</p>

		<p>
		  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;">Methods:</span>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">The categorization of tumors into the grading system and molecular subtypes was determined based on a thorough review of existing literature. Tumors were categorized into grade 1 (non-aggressive) and grade 3 (aggressive). Similarly, molecular subtypes included Luminal A, Normal-like (non-aggressive), and Luminal B, Basal-like, HER2-positive (aggressive) subtypes. Differential expression analysis was performed on the breast cancer dataset GSE25055 using the limma package in R to assess the effectiveness of two classifications in differentiating aggressiveness levels in breast cancer. The dataset comprised gene expression data for both the grading system (grade 1 and grade 3) and molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Normal-like, Luminal B, Basal-like, and HER2-positive subtypes).</span>
		</p>

		<p>
		  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;">Results:</span>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">Significant gene expression differences were identified between non-aggressive and aggressive tumor groups based on the grading system and molecular subtypes. These findings highlight the potential of these classification approaches in accurately differentiating aggressiveness levels in breast cancer.</span>
		</p>

		<p>
		  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</span>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the grading system and molecular subtypes in differentiating aggressiveness levels in breast cancer. Breast cancer classification based on aggressiveness is crucial for treatment decisions and patient prognosis. This study sets the stage for further investigations and emphasizes the significance of accurate breast cancer classification.</span>

		<p>
		  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;">8- Next Step: </span>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">In the next phase of this research, following the completion of Project 1 and the subsequent Project 2 and 3 utilizing the grading system, the focus will shift towards conducting a differential expression (DE) analysis with the subtype-based classification. Specifically, the DE analysis will involve comparing the gene expression profiles between the Luminal A and Normal-like subtypes versus the Luminal B, Basal-like, and HER2 subtypes. </span>
		  <span style="font-size: 20px;">By performing this DE analysis with the subtype groups, the aim is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the differential expression associated with different aggressiveness levels in breast cancer. The obtained results from the subtypes analysis will be compared with the existing findings derived from the grading system analysis, which has already been conducted.</span>
