Research Experience
University of Teesside, UK	2020 – 2022
Dissertation, Gene Expression Profiling for Aggressive Breast Cancer: A Microarray Meta-Analysis Approach in R (Jan 2022 – Jun 2022)
Executed pipeline in R to combine multiple microarray datasets consisting of more than 450 tissue samples, through comprehensive literature review and data pre-analysis in NetworkAnalyst. Recognised and implemented REM as most effective meta-analysis method using GeneMeta package in R.
•	Interpreted and identified potential biomarkers for diagnostic and screening purposes based on most differentially expressed genes.
•	Wrote and edited manuscript for submission to Breast Cancer Research and Treatment Journal.
Internship Project (Sept 2021 – Dec 2021)
Generated initial stages of dissertation project, including large-scale data collection and extraction.
•	Differentiated between early stage (Grade I) and advanced stage (Grade III) of breast cancer through identification of DEGs as biomarkers.
•	Developed in-depth understanding of GEO databases and PubMed for data analysis purposes.
Pasteur Institute of Iran	2016 – 2020
Research Assistant (Oct 2017 – Jan 2020)
Interpreted research results, prepared internal project discussions, wrote reports, and organised presentations based on research results. Directed master students and junior researchers to complete project-related tasks.
•	Led technical support and presented student workshops for project: Identification of Mutation in NF1 Gene, Responsible for Overlapping Clinical Symptoms of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome using Whole-Exome Sequencing. 
•	Independently established baselines and bioinformatic workflow of project: Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Palifermin and other Interventions on the Oral Mucositis Caused by Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Cancer Patients Receiving Stem Cell Transplantation.
Volunteer Research Assistant (Jan 2016 – Sept 2017)
Conducted comprehensive literature reviews, evaluated NGS techniques and meta-analysis techniques.
•	Wrote reports and prepared presentations for project: Evaluation of Genetic Variations Among Patients Suffering from Ventricular Septal Defect Utilizing Whole Exome Sequencing Technique.
•	Researched Epigenetics and assisted in presentations for project: Drug Resistant Prostate Cancer and Epigenetics Data.
•	Translated book “RNA-seq Data Analysis – A Practical Approach” in English to Persian.
