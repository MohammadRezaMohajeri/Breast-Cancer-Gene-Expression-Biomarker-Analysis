# Breast-Cancer-Gene-Expression-Biomarker-Analysis
This meta-analysis project aimed to identify potential biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis through a comprehensive gene expression profiling analysis. To achieve this, 468 grade 1 and 3 breast cancer samples, from 4 microarray breast cancer GEO datasets, were integrated using REM meta-analysis with GeneMeta Bioconductor R package  (all on the same platform, technology, and biological specimens). After identifying common DEGs among all four datasets, I also obtained meta-combined DEGs and conducted functional analysis.
