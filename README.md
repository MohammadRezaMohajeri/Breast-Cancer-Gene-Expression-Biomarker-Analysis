## Introduction

This project aims to identify potential biomarkers in breast cancer using differential gene expression analysis and meta-analysis techniques. For a more detailed background and objectives, please refer to [Project Summary](https://mohammadrezamohajeri.github.io/Breast-Cancer-Gene-Expression-Biomarker-Analysis/Pages/Project_Summary.html).

## Phase 1: Differential Expression Analysis of Breast Cancer Dataset (GSE25055) using limma in R: Comparing Molecular Subtypes and Grading System

In Phase 1, we prepared the gene expression datasets for analysis, employing quality control measures and normalization techniques.
