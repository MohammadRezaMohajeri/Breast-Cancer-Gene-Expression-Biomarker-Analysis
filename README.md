# Breast-Cancer-Gene-Expression-Biomarker-Analysis
This meta-analysis project aimed to identify potential biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis through a comprehensive gene expression profiling analysis. The study utilized 468 grade 1 and 3 breast cancer samples from four microarray breast cancer GEO datasets, all of which were on the same platform, technology, and biological specimens. Integration was achieved using REM meta-analysis with the GeneMeta Bioconductor R package. Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among all four datasets, and meta-combined DEGs were obtained and subjected to functional analysis.
